# DevOps CI/CD Pipeline for Node.js Application

This repository implements a CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application using GitHub Actions. The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the application.

## Approach

### Steps:
1. **CI Workflow**: The pipeline is triggered on `push` or `pull_request` events to the `main` branch.
2. **Build**: Installs dependencies, runs tests, and builds a Docker image of the Node.js application.
3. **Push to DockerHub**: The Docker image is tagged with the commit hash and pushed to DockerHub.
4. **Kubernetes Deployment (Optional)**: Deploys the Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster (optional step, depending on your setup).
5. **Notifications**: Slack notifications are sent on deployment success or failure.

### Tools & Technologies:
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation.
- **Docker** for containerizing the application.
- **Slack Webhook** for deployment notifications.
- **Kubernetes** (Optional) for container orchestration.

### Setup

1. **GitHub Secrets**: Configure DockerHub credentials (`DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`), Kubernetes configuration (`KUBECONFIG`), and Slack webhook URL (`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`) in GitHub Secrets.
2. **Kubernetes Cluster** (Optional): Set up a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Google Kubernetes Engine or AWS EKS) and add your `kubeconfig` to GitHub Secrets.

### How to Trigger the Pipeline:
- Make a change to the repository and push it to the `main` branch, or create a pull request to the `main` branch.
- The pipeline will automatically trigger and execute all steps: testing, building, pushing Docker image, and deploying (if Kubernetes is configured).

### Notes:
- The Slack notification will notify you upon the success or failure of the deployment.
- Kubernetes deployment is optional but can be enabled by configuring the `kubeconfig` file.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the automation of the full deployment pipeline for a Node.js application, including building Docker images, pushing them to DockerHub, and deploying to Kubernetes, all while integrating automated testing and notifications.
